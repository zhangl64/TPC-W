TPC-W pure open queueing network to-do list:

1. When lambda is large, EB.java - run() method prints a lot of messages, because:
	if(html == null ) { log("Restarting user session");}
	Trace back because getHTML() method returns null. Need more concern to identify the reason behind it.

2. When running time is long, and lambda is large, some of EBs can not suicide (still alive) at the end.

3. User input parameter of Think Time should be removed; use lambda instead.

4. In RBE.java - negExp() method, the values of max and IMax need to be verified.

5. The number of EBs is hard-coded, shouldn't be one of user inputs, infinity?
