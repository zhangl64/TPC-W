This is a designed TPC-W benchmark for pure open queueing networks:
- The main thread sleeps an exponentially distributed time interval before sending a request.
- If an EB is waiting there, the EB will get the "job" and send one request to the server.
- If no EBs is available, the main thread starts a new EB, and the new EB send a request immediately.
